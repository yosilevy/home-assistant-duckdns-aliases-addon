# home-assistant-duckdns-aliases-addon
An upgrade to HA's duckdns addon (https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/blob/master/duckdns/README.md) which works around aliases issues.
This applies a simple workaround - doing the renew process without the alises and then right after doing it with. For some reason this works.

Install addon locally using instructions in step 2 at https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/add-ons/tutorial
